Instead of a lightsaber, the average person wields a vibroweapon. A little subtler, maybe, but can be just as deadly when wielded in the right hands.</p><p><strong>Extraterrestrial Electrostaff</strong><br>A quarterstaff that&#x2019;ll knock you off your feet. The electricity running through this is no joke- the instantaneous muscle tension it causes can throw you back with concussive force.</p><p><strong>Starship Socketwrench</strong><br>The mechanics choice. When you&#x2019;re hurtling through space at the speed of light, you want to make sure that you know how to repair any issues that might find their way onboard- or how to destroy them.</p><p><strong>Darkside Lightsaber</strong><br>Though difficult, some powerful mages and force-sensitives have managed to twist the potent energy of the kyber crystals to serve evil rather than good.</p><p><strong>Crossguard Lightsaber</strong><br>The instability of this saber makes it a dangerous tool. Whether you choose light or dark, you will follow the irresistible pull of the force with this sword by your side.</p><p><strong>Alliance Lightsaber</strong><br>Known and feared, a lightsaber lives up to its legacy as an elegant weapon for a more civilized age. Modern comforts have made it possible for you to own and wield this tool with ease.</p><p><strong>Solo Blaster</strong><br>We&#x2019;ve all heard it- ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster by your side. Whether or not it&#x2019;s actually true, scoundrels and players alike will be glad to have this weapon in their arsenal!</p><p><strong>Planetary Pickaxe</strong><br>Unearthed in the mines of Naboo, this humble pickaxe was built to quarry Alum and little else. Guided by your hand, though, there&#x2019;s no telling what it can do!</p><p><strong>Dark Matter Drill</strong><br>Once intangible and existing only in theory, dark matter evades our capture despite it making up the majority of the universe. This pickaxe claims to be able to strike through it- whether or not this is true is yet to be seen.</p><p><strong>Moondust Miner</strong><br>Who knows what secrets lie beneath the lunar surface? Grab this pickaxe and start moving moon rocks and tearing through titanium basalts- there are countless mysteries just waiting to be uncovered.</p><p><strong>Midi-Chlorian Mace</strong><br>Originally meant to show the affinity for an individual to pull at the threads of the universe, this deeply hated concept has been repurposed to measure a new kind of force: that of a blunt weapon when bashed into someone&apos;s skull.</p><p><strong>Meteorite Masher</strong><br>Batter moons, bash meteors, and break anything in your way! This weapon is built to whack, wallop, and win!</p><p><strong>Polaris Poleaxe</strong><br>The north star sits proudly in the sky, a beacon for all who see it. Let this weapon be your guiding light in the darkness of battle.</p><p><strong>Dune Digger</strong><br>You don&apos;t like sand. It&apos;s coarse and rough and irritating- and it gets everywhere<em>.</em> Thankfully, this shovel will let you move sand wherever you&#x2019;d like- ideally as far away from you as possible.</p><p><strong>Crater Creator</strong><br>Strike the ground with the force of a thousand asteroids! Empty chasms and cleared chunks are at your fingertips with the potent power of this tool.</p><p><strong>Supernova Spade</strong><br>Dig into the milky way. Scoop the very stars out of the sky. Work tirelessly under the watchful gaze of an infinite galaxy as pieces die and are reborn.</p><p><strong>Stormtrooper Sunglasses</strong><br>Being a cog in the machine is hard work, especially when being blinded by blaster pistols are an everyday risk! These sick shades protect your eyes and help keep you cool in the heat of battle.</p><p><strong>Penumbra Paletot</strong><br>Stitched and sewn on the dark side of the moon, the depths of this strange cape are as dark as a black hole and seemingly as bottomless. If you put something in your pocket, there&#x2019;s no guarantee the void won&#x2019;t keep it.</p><p><strong>Sith Lord Slacks</strong><br>A master of evil can&#x2019;t be seen shopping for asteroid belts! These pants are perfectly fitted and the perfect elegant touch to your villainous look.</p><p><strong>Yoda Slippers</strong><br>Ask anybody you know- they&#x2019;ll be able to recognize the trademark ears and mint green color. Any vendor will tell you: the easiest way to have a jedi with you, this is. In comfort, your path you must follow.</p><p><strong>Astronauts Helmet</strong><br>The most important piece of equipment for a human space sailor. No need to worry; this helmet will keep you safe as the wonders of the galaxy take your breath away.</p><p><strong>Astronauts Chestplate</strong><br>An industry standard for pilots across the galaxy! Keep yourself safe in the navigator seat with this anti-radiation plate.</p><p><strong>Astronauts Leggings</strong><br>Outshine the competition! Made from the fabric of space and studded with stars, these pants are for those who know they&#x2019;re dazzling.</p><p><strong>Spacewalk Sneakers</strong><br>The rockets in the heels of these shoes are critical to move around in zero gravity. Not quite powerful enough for flight while planetside!</p><p><strong>Mandalorian Helmet</strong><br>Durasteel and Beskar come together to make one of the most identifiable pieces of armor around. Conceal your identity, and your weaknesses.</p><p><strong>Beskar Chestplate</strong><br>In the farthest reaches of space, a master armorer stepped out of a nether portal into the forge of a mandalorian. The result? A piece of near-unbreakable armor forged in both netherite and beskar.</p><p><strong>Beskar Leggings</strong><br>Mobility is important to any great bounty hunter! These stretchy and durable chromasheath pants use mandalorian steel splints to optimize both dexterity and defense.</p><p><strong>Beskar Boots</strong><br>For every step forward, know that this is the way. You are as durable and unyielding as this armor. Move through the battlefield with the grace and practiced steps of a warrior.<br></p></div></div><h2></h2><h2 id="craft-your-own-starsaber">Craft your own STARSABER</h2><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://catcraft.net/content/images/2022/05/starsabers.gif" class="kg-image" alt="StarCats Update" loading="lazy" width="380" height="54"></figure><p>We&apos;ve added 7 collectible Starsabers to all the Realms!<br>There are blue, orange, yellow, green, pink, purple, and red colours available!<br></p><p>To obtain a Starsaber, you must grind for <strong>x5 Kyber Crystal shards</strong>.<br>Kyber Crystal shards can only be found through slaying various hostile mobs on the server.</p><ul><li><strong>Blue</strong> Kyber shards can be found by slaying Drowned zombies.</li><li><strong>Green</strong> Kyber shards can be found by slaying Creepers.</li><li><strong>Orange</strong> Kyber shards can be found by slaying Ghasts.</li><li><strong>Pink</strong> Kyber shards can be found by slaying Zombie pigman.</li><li><strong>Purple</strong> Kyber shards can be found by slaying the Ender dragon.</li><li><strong>Red</strong> Kyber shards can be found by slaying Piglin brutes.</li><li><strong>Yellow</strong> Kyber shards can be found by slaying blazes.</li></ul><p>Once you&apos;ve collected x5 unique Kyber shards, travel to <code>/spawn</code> and speak with the metal smith villager, inside the ship near the pinata spawnpoint. </p><div class="kg-card kg-callout-card kg-callout-card-blue"><div class="kg-callout-emoji">&#x1F48E;</div><div class="kg-callout-text">Some Kyber shards are rarer to find than others!</div></div><p></p><h2 id="nether-world-reset">Nether World Reset</h2><p>The Nether world will reset this week!

Hence, you&apos;ll have all the qualities of 1.18 terrain to discover, explore and collect the new blocks and items in a world that is fully up-to-date with the latest additions. The Resource world will reset to 1.18 in 2 days. </p><h2 id="nether-end-worlds">Nether &amp; End Worlds</h2><hr><p>The Nether and End will update to 1.18. The End World will reset at the end of December 2021. The Nether will reset at the end of January 2022. </p><h2 id="blue-realm">Blue Realm</h2><hr><p>The overworld borders for Blue Realm will expand from 30000x30000 to 35000x35000 and feature the new Caves &amp; Cliffs: Part II terrain. ALL chunks are updated to 1.18! </p><p></p><h2 id="red-realm">Red Realm</h2><hr><p>The overworld borders for Red Realm will expand from 15000x15000 to 25000x25000 and feature the new Caves &amp; Cliffs: Part II terrain. ALL chunks are updated to 1.18! <br><strong><strong><u>Note:</u></strong></strong> The Overworld for both Realms will <strong><strong><u>not</u></strong></strong> reset - your progress is SAFE! The world-borders will expand and the new 1.18 caves will generate. </p><p></p><h2 id="green-realm">Green Realm</h2><hr><p>The Green Realm will contain the same enjoyable features and additions in the Blue and Red Realms. The Overworld will use a 1.18 seed and is completely brand new. Therefore if you missed out on the blue or red realm releases, now will be an excellent opportunity to start early. We will also be bringing out hardware performance improvements to support the new 1.18 update and the Green Realm.</p><p>The estimated release date for Green Realm: <strong><strong>Start of January 2022</strong></strong></p><p></p><h2 id="server-optimizations">Server Optimizations</h2><hr><p>We&apos;ve made the necessary optimizations to improve performance and chunk generation on 1.18. Gameplay should feel faster and overall much smoother. We will be shifting to a new server at the end of the month to support a new Green Realm and offer further improved performance with newer hardware across all realms. This big transition will eliminate the recent server crashes. The estimated date for the scheduled hardware transfer is the <strong>5th January 2022 UTC</strong>, anywhere between <strong>1 AM-1 PM UTC</strong>. We will confirm exact times &amp; dates as we get closer to the end of the year!</p><p></p><h2 id="thank-you">THANK YOU</h2><hr><p>Thank you, everyone, for playing on CatCraft this year! </p><p>To all our supporters, thank you very much for your generosity! With your support, we could continue bringing exciting new updates, server additions, hardware improvements, seasonal events, and so much more! </p><p>We wish you all a wonderful Xmas break and a happy new year :)</p><p></p> ]]>
